# Introduction
CRoSSeD (CRF Representation of Smoothed Structural Data) is a Perl algorithm designed to train and test binding site models using Conditional Random Fields. However the actual CRF implementation is derived from the open source tool, CRF++. The CRoSSeD algorithm generates the correct CRF template (see help CRF++) for binding site prediction, parses the biological data for CRF training and offers two extensions, an optimization extension and correction extension.
